  <h1>Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Sweden</h1>

  <h2>COVID-19 Cases: Sweden, Nordic Countries, and Europe</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/ani_SWE_NOR_EUR_cases.gif" alt="COVID-19 Case Animation"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    The first noticeable increase in COVID-19 cases in Sweden occurred in late 2020, followed by a major surge in spring 2021 during the Alpha variant wave. 
    January 2021 marked a peak in cases for both Sweden and other Nordic countries. While Europe's numbers were lower statistically, this may reflect less extensive testing compared to the Nordic region.
  </h3>

  <h2>COVID-19 Deaths: Sweden, Nordic Countries, and Europe</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/ani_SWE_NOR_EUR_deaths.gif" alt="COVID-19 Deaths Animation"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    The data clearly shows that Sweden experienced significantly higher COVID-19 mortality rates compared to other Nordic countries and Europe.
  </h3>

  <h2>COVID-19 Cases in Nordic Countries</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/multiple_plots_cases.png" alt="Nordic COVID-19 Cases"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    The total number of cases in each Nordic country followed similar trends, but Sweden reported the highest numbers during the early waves in late 2020 and early 2021.
  </h3>

  <h2>COVID-19 Deaths in Nordic Countries</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/multiple_plots_deaths.png" alt="Nordic COVID-19 Deaths"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Sweden consistently recorded the highest death toll during major pandemic waves among the Nordic countries.
  </h3>

  <h2>Total Deaths vs COVID-19 Deaths: Sweden vs Europe</h2>
  <div class="object">
    <object type="text/html" data="../images/plotly-stack-bar-comparison.html"></object>
  </div>
  <h3>
    In 2020, COVID-19 accounted for approximately 10% of all deaths in Sweden. This proportion confirms the significant impact of the pandemic on national mortality.
  </h3>

  <h2>COVID-19 Deaths in Sweden by Age Group</h2>
  <div class="object">
    <object type="text/html" data="../images/plotly-BAR-deaths_age.html"></object>
  </div>
  <h3>
    COVID-19 posed the greatest risk to individuals over 70, particularly those aged 90 and above.
  </h3>

  <h1>Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Sweden</h1>

  <h2>Inflation in Sweden and Nordic Countries (2010–2024)</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/plot_inflation_SWE_NOR.png" alt="Inflation Sweden Nordic"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    The pandemic had a clear economic impact, leading to inflationary pressure across the Nordic region, including Sweden, despite initially avoiding strict lockdowns.
  </h3>

  <h2>Inflation in Sweden and Europe (2010–2024)</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/plot_inflation_SWE_EUR.png" alt="Inflation Sweden Europe"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    A significant increase in inflation occurred in 2020 and 2021. Although Sweden’s inflation peaked below the European average, the upward trend followed a similar trajectory.
  </h3>

  <h2>Unemployment in Sweden and Nordic Countries</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/plot_unemployment_SWE_NOR.png" alt="Unemployment Sweden Nordic"/>
  </div>

  <h2>Unemployment in Sweden and Europe</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/plot_unemployment_SWE_EUR.png" alt="Unemployment Sweden Europe"/>
  </div>
  <h3>
    Sweden’s unemployment rate increased more noticeably than in other Nordic and European countries. Contributing factors may include high immigration levels, challenges with language integration, and a rigid labor market that makes layoffs difficult due to strong employee protections.
  </h3>

  <h2>COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout in Sweden</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/plot_vaccine_doses_SWE.png" alt="Vaccine Doses Sweden"/>
  </div>

  <h2>Cumulative COVID-19 Deaths in Sweden</h2>
  <div class="plot">
    <img src="../images/plot_cummulative_deaths_SWE.png" alt="Cumulative Deaths Sweden"/>
  </div>
  <h3>After the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination programs, the upward trend in total deaths came to a halt, suggesting a stabilizing effect associated with the immunization efforts.</h3>
